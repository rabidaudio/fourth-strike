# Privacy Policy

We care about privacy a lot, and don't like Internet monopolies. For that reason, we
don't collect any information on site visitors, and keep the information we collect
on our members and fans to an absolute minimum.

Fourth Strike as an entity exists for two purposes:

1. To distribute and sell music and merchandise for our artists, and
2. to pay artists royalties for said distribution.

We collect, store, and share data for these purposes only, and do so to the bare minimum
extent necessary to perform these tasks.

## Information We Collect

### From Site Visitors

We have no need or desire to collect information from visitors to our site. Internet
monopolies often provide tools and services for website owners that can be used to
track visitors on that site. For that reason, this site does not use Google Fonts,
Google Analytics, or any other Google service. We serve our fonts directly and do
not collect any traffic metrics or any other user data. We don't collect your IPs,
we don't collect your browser fingerprints, we don't track your location or even
how you got to this site. We do not use cookies except in a very limited, optional
capacity that only applies to using Discord login (see below).

### From Our Fans

Being a customer of ours by buying music or merchandise or streaming our music
necessitates a certain amount of your Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
be shared in order to facilitate the transaction.

Fourth Strike as an organization does not collect customer PII directly. We use
external services to facilitate these transactions, including but not limited
to Bandcamp, Printify, Patreon, and Paypal. Depending on how you access our music,
other companies such as Spotify, YouTube, or Facebook may also collect your 
information and track your behavior. Please refer to their privacy policies and
make your own decisions about which of these services you wish to interact with.

These service providers share your PII with us and/or with each other, which may
include name, shipping address, email, etc. Fourth Strike does not store this
information, and only accesses and uses it to the extent required to fulfill
your order (for example, using your shipping address to send you items you
ordered, or using your email address to contact you in the case of an issue).


### From Our Artists/Members

As a member of Fourth Strike, we do collect and store some additional PII in order
to facilitate paying out royalties. This includes your Discord handle (if you have
one) in order to contact you and allow you to login to the site, an email address
associated with a Paypal account to send royalty payments to, and one or more names
used to identify you, which can be aliases or internet handles and do not need to be
your legal name. If you previously released music with Fourth Strike under a different
name, we may store your past names in order to ensure royalties are properly assigned.
For some releases, DistroKid requires a first and last name for songwriters. We will
also store any additional contact information that you choose to share with us (e.g.
additional email addresses, social media accounts, etc.).

All of this information is visible only to administrators of Fourth Strike unless you
choose to make it public, and only used for the purposes of computing and paying out
royalties, or contacting you should there be an issue in doing so.

If there's a Discord handle associated with your profile, you may choose to authenticate
with the site using the "Login with Discord" button. Doing so will allow you to update
your contact and payment information and your public profile. This requires a cookie
to be stored in your browser. It's a "first-party" cookie; it's only used by the site,
isn't accessible to other domains, and isn't used to track your behavior across the site.
This cookie is used to keep you logged in between visits. This feature is completely
optional. You may choose instead to contact a Fourth Strike administrator to update your
information.


## How Information Is Shared

Fourth Strike does not share PII for customers or artists for any reason outside the bare minimum
extent required to facilitate orders and pay royalties.

Should a government agency request data, Fourth Strike will only share said information when
legally compelled to, such as in response to a court order or subpoena. We attempt to notify users
about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or
court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in
our discretion, that the requests are over-broad, vague, or lack proper authority.


## Your Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data

Some jurisdictions grant additional privacy rights and legal protections to customers, such as
the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Fourth Strike chooses to grant
these rights to all users regardless of jurisdiction.

You have a right to receive an export of any data we have collected, and to make edits to the data.

You have a right to have some or all of your personal data deleted.
